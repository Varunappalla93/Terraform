Day 30

Terraform is Infrastructure as a code (IaaC) tool.
Can connect to any platform, multicloud, has version control,  we can have history of our infra, easy to restore.
can track changes and review, consistent infra acroess all envs.

CRUD - can check AWS services, inventory management

Cost optimization
Dependency management - automatic in terraform

Reusable infra using terraform modules

Install terraform on mac -> 
brew tap hashicorp/tap 
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

terraform --version ->
Terraform v1.14.5
on darwin_arm64

Now install aws cli v2 to connect to aws account and services and run aws configure

Providers - AWS is our provider in our case.

count based loops are for list -> count.index
for based loop for set -> set or map -> each.key and each.value
dynamic block - we get special variable with block name, eg: ingress
data source - query the provider for existing information

state - terraform tracks what it had created in state file, it is like memory to terraform.

.tf files  - declarative based infra

actual infra - what is actually created inside provider

desired infra - what terraform created

actual infra = desired infra

terraform creates resources in provider and stores in terraform.tfstate file

if terraform apply -auto-approve is given again and if its state file is matching with actual infra, no changes are applied

one previous state backup file will be available, i.e. .terraform.tfstate.backup file

state file is locked by terraform when we perform terraform actions

terraform.tf files is for us
state file is for terraform

In Collaboration env, state should be stored in remote like s3 bucket, so we can prevent errors and duplicated,
it should be locked and parallel modifications should not be allowed.

No one should not have access to delete terraform remote state file except terraform

versions should ne enabled and data replication should be done another bucket

locals are like variables with extra capabilities

Provisioners - to take actions or run scripts before or after the task, they only execute while creation or destroy, but not
at updating of resources.
